# Jincor bounty sender


This is the script I used to send the tokens earned by bounty hunters during Jincor
ICO campaign. The script can be also used for token airdrops.

# Installation


To install the environment all you need to do is to run `npm i`

# Configure

1. Fill `input.csv` file with the amounts of tokens and recepient addresses.
2. `cp .env.example .env` and  then edit `.env` file to match your params

# RUN

`node sendBounty.js`
